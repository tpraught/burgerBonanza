# BURGER BONANZA
Mastering Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebards, and ORM

## Objectives
 - Burger Bonanza is a restaurant app that lets users add a new burger they would like to eat
 - Or, they can choose one that is already listed to be devoured!
 - The devoured burgers will then be moved into a separate section
 - The database will track all of the burgers, whether they have been devoured or not
